To detect lines in the images, see line_detection.py. 

To detect various objects in images, see sign_detection.py. This program uses OpenCV DNN (Deep Neural Network, for live image processing) and MobileNet-SSD v2 (a lightweight machine learning model). If the camera detects a stop sign, the raspberry pi will tell the car to stop moving for several seconds and then resume moving.
